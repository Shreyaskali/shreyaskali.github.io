## Recreational Problems

Also known as "brain teasers," these problems usually involve little formal mathematics, but instead rely on creative use of basic strategic principles. They are excellent to work on, because no special knowledge is needed, and any time spent thinking about a recreational problem will help you later with more mathematically sophisticated problems. A gold mine of excellent recreational problems is the work of Martin Gardner, who edited the "Mathematical Games" department for Scientific American for many years. Many of his articles have been collected into books.
