#### How to use <b>ReLib</b>
{: .fs-4 }

Relib is inspired by the Zettlekasten method of note taking where each page is interlinked with a set of pages building a network of interconnected ideas. But **ReLib** uses a slightly modified system where initially the main pages are divided into the different domains (Mathematics, Computer Science, Data Science, Statistics & Machine Learning, Physics & Quantum computing) under which you will find parent page for Learning, Preparation, Projects & Research. These pages have heirarchical division and all the hanging pages (pages having no child page) will be interconnected through backlinks, tags, etc.

(*put nice image here to explain the above paragraph*)

All the resources metioned in the pages will be linked and stored under Resource Library. If you wish you can browse the resource library through this page.

A nice search feature is always helpful (available on top) if you feel lost or unable to find someting...
